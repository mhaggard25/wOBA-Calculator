This is a simple application that takes the year the user desires and a link from baseball-reference to give the user the player's wOBA for the year. The webpage must be accessed by going to Game Logs and selecting a year, then you copy that url and paste it in the program. The program will then tell you the player's name and their wOBA for the year.

This is an example of the webpage that must be used: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bondsba01.shtml

The year that the user provides connects to fangraphs wOBA table here: https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=cn
